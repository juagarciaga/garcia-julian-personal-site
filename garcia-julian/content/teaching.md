I am Director of [Undergraduate Studies](https://www.monash.edu/it/future-students/choose-a-degree) at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.monash.edu/it/).

I currently teach [Computational Modelling and Simulation](https://handbook.monash.edu/2020/units/FIT3139) (formerly known as Computational Science).

I have also taught:

- [FIT1008/FIT2085](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2014handbooks/units/FIT1008.html) – Introduction to Computer Science.
- [FIT 4012](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/units/FIT4012.html) – Advanced Computational Science.
- [FIT 1016](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2014handbooks/units/FIT1016.html) and [FIT2044](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2014handbooks/units/FIT2044.html) – Advanced projects Levels 1 and 2
- [FIT 1029](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2014handbooks/units/FIT1029.html) – Algorithmic Problem Solving.

A while back I taught:
