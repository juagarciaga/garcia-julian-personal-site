I am Associate Professor at the [Faculty of Information Technology](href='http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/ "Faculty of Information Technology"), [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu.au/ "Monash University").

My research seeks to understand how self-interested agents (primarily machines and humans) can learn to coordinate their actions without a central planner. I am particularly interested in social dilemmas, cooperation, and situations where rational behaviour leads to poor information for everyone. This can be applied to: Multiagent systems and AI, Social Dynamics and Behaviour, Energy and other IT Systems.

I teach [computer science](https://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/units/FIT1008.html), [algorithms](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2015handbooks/units/FIT1029.html) and [computational modelling and simulation](https://handbook.monash.edu/current/units/FIT3139).

I am Director of [Academic Programs](https://www.monash.edu/it/future-students/choose-a-degree) at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://www.monash.edu/it/) and have led processes of curriculum design and accreditation across [all our educational offerings](https://www.monash.edu/it/future-students).
