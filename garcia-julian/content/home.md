I am Associate Professor at the [Faculty of Information Technology](href='http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/ "Faculty of Information Technology"), [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu.au/ "Monash University").

My research seeks to understand how self-interested agents (primarily machines and humans) can learn to coordinate their actions without a central planner. We use game theory and simulations and apply this framework to study: Multiagent systems and AI, the Dynamics of Social Behaviour, and other systems where human strategic behaviour intersects with technology. 

I teach [computer science](https://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/units/FIT1008.html), [algorithms](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2015handbooks/units/FIT1029.html) and [computational modelling and simulation](https://handbook.monash.edu/current/units/FIT3139).

I am part of the [Optmisation group](https://www.monash.edu/it/dsai/optimisation) in the [Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.monash.edu/it/dsai).
