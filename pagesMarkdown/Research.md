###### **Research Themes**

My research revolves around the question of how groups of agents can learn to coordinate individual decisions to achieve collective goals. Most of my research focuses on social dilemmas, i.e., situations where poor group outcomes arise from optimal individual choices. We use this framework to study: Multi-agent Systems and AI, Social Systems, and Models in Biology and Evolution. Please check my publications for more details.

###### **PhD opportunities**

I am always interested in hearing from potential PhD students. Should you be interested in doing a PhD with me, please read one of my papers and briefly tell me how it relates to your own research interests —I may not be able to reply to your introduction email if you fail to do this.

[Here’s how you can apply to do a PhD with me at Monash](http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/degrees/prospective-students/how-to-apply.html). We have a competitive scholarship scheme that can pay for living expenses and fees.
