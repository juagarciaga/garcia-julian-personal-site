I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Faculty of Information Technology](href='http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/ "Faculty of Information Technology"), [Monash University](http://www.monash.edu.au/ "Monash University").

My research seeks to understand how self-interested agents (machines, humans and other animals) can learn to coordinate their actions without a central planner. I am particularly interested in social dilemmas and cooperation.

I teach [computer science](https://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/units/FIT1008.html), [algorithms](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/2015handbooks/units/FIT1029.html) and [computational modelling and simulation](https://handbook.monash.edu/current/units/FIT3139).

I am Director of [BSc Computer Science](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2020/computer-science-c2001), [BSc Computer Science with Honours](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2020/computer-science-advanced-c3001?domestic=true), and [BSc Computer Science Advanced](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2020/computer-science-advanced-c3001?domestic=true).
